Crypto-Engine-Contiki
============================

The OpenMote (cc2538) platform offers hardware crypto engines supporting SHA256, AES, and Public Key Crypto operations. We utilize the crypto engines for all crypto operations involved in DTLS to have a better performance.

In this repo, we share the required drivers to access the crypto engines, and a modified DTLS implementation that can both run on softwarebased crypto libriaries, but most importantly as well supports the hardware crypto.

We would like to share:
 * the drivers for the crypto engine in cpu/cc2538/dev/
 * example code how to use the crypo engines' API in example/cc2538dk/crypto
 * the modified tinydtls-based implemention of DTLS in examples/tinydtls

Ongoing work:
 * We are evaluating our implementation thoroughly and plan to share our resutls in the near future.

 * Wen Hu and his team <wen.hu@unsw.edu.au>
